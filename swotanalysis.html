    <h1>Streangths: Researching the internet has always been a strong point for me as I like to get a broader perspective on different views. 
      Through this attribute I am able to collectively gain greater information and pick out what to use and interpret for myself.</h1>
  
  <h2>Weaknesses: Asking for extra support is something I should be doing more often, as I can be too focused on trying to finish a task by myself. 
    I believe that working more in teams will help me ask sooner for the experience and expertises others may have.<h2>
    
    <h3>Opportunities: If I adopt a more open style to my work â€“ for example discussing with my colleagues, professor or tutor, early on what I am aiming to do,
      and discuss with them ideas for tackling the most challenging aspects of a piece of work, 
      I will become better at both anticipating issues and using the skills and knowledge of people around me more effectively.<h3>
      
      
      <h4>Time management was in the past an area of improvement for me. However, since I started military service in Switzerland this has vastly improved.<h4>
