    <h1> In my original upload for the application of this course, I had written these words: 
"In my prior education I learned the basic foundations of Java as well as SQL. My very first programming related experience was when I was 12,
      I started using a programm called Scratch, which is programming games but without coding. Currently I am self teaching the language Python." Since then, a lot has changed. 
  During my time in the military, I started learning python in the little free time that I had. Even though I was pleased with my productivity, 
      there was still something I wanted to gain before starting this course. So i decided to go on a 2 week programming course at a University in Germany for Python. This has so far turned out to be a great 
      decision as it has helped me gain a deeper understanding of algorithmic thinking.
