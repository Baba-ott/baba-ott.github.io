<p1>How reading can shape minds</p1>


<div class="text-boxblog">
    <h1>Life before literature was practical and predictable, but in present day, literature has expanded into countless libraries and into the minds of many as the gateway for comprehension. 
      It is the journey that is inscribed in pages and powered by the imagination of the reader. Literature opens our eyes and makes us to see more than just what the front door shows. In everyday life,
      literature connects individuals with larger truths and ideas. In a society literature is the foundation of life. It places an emphasis on many topics from human tragedies to tales of the ever-popular search for love. 
      These words come alive in the imagination of the mind and its ability to comprehend the complexity or simplicity of the text.  
      There is a trend in the society that one who is more inclined towards science and math will somehow be more successful in life and that one who is more passionate toward literature and other art forms will be destined to a life of low-paying jobs and unsatisfying careers.
      But the reality is it provides growth, strengthens our minds and gives us the ability to think outside the box. </h1>
