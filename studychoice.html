    <h1> Study choice activities: Visiting the HZ open day back in November as well as attending all the ICT online information sessions to strengthn my decision for choosing this course. </h1>
  
  <h2>Motivate your study: From a young age, interacting with the growing world of the internet has always been exciting for me to learn about, specifically the development of technology used to improve everyday life.
    I prefer a course that is highly focused on the application of technology and offers students the chance to experience first hand working alongside the learning part.
    HZ offers a great range of theory and practical elements to develop my personal skills. </h2>
    
  <h3>After completing the study: Work for a company that develops technological solutions for other businesses, or even in the gaming industry where I have an interest. 
    That could be in factory automation, or interfacing different technologies together to solve a client's needs. Programmer, product developer, project implementation and data analyst all interest me. 
    I would like to be part of the team that finds solutions to business challenges and implement these until they work for the client.  Also working with more experienced people will help me in my early years of developing my skills.
I see this study helping me increase my knowledge in certain areas, increase my understanding of how the technology industry functions, and above all develop personal skills needed to make a contribution to a company.  </h3>
