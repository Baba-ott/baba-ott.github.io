    <h1>Hi Maurice,

Thank you for filling in the who am I form! By reading through your motivation and the future job description, I can tell you really put a great effort into the details and inform yourself of what it is you would like to achieve. I do believe our program will be a good fit for you.

You are definitely not alone in needing to learn to ask for help. It is very much a developer's trade to not do so, however within a project and a deadline to achieve you cannot afford not to. You will get a chance within the program to start developing these skills.

In regards to your question, you will have a study career coach appointed to you who will be having a quarterly conversation with and based on your personal situation can refer you to other support (Dean, Psychologist etc) We also offer a Buddy program, a fellow second years student who will show you how everything works and where to find information or ask for help. We make use of class assistants who will help too and because of the open culture, the door of the teacher's rooms is always open to getting help and guidance. We also have an international office that will help you with Dutch culture specifics.

Looking forward to seeing you soon

Kind regards,

Daphne Heertjes </h1>
