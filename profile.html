      <p1> Extra curricular activities:
        A part time job I used to have was being an Ubereats delivery rider. 
        I enjoyed this job quite a lot because it gets me some active exercise 
        on my bike, plus it's a good way to get to know a city even better. 
        My favourite hobby at the moment includes calisthenics and electronic 
        music production. Recently I have also started to advance my coding 
        skills by picking up Python programming.
