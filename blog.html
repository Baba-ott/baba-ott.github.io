      <h2>Programming experience</h2>
      <h5>As mentioned on my homepage, my earliest experience of any coding was with scratch, a user-friendly coding software for making games or even other animations.</h5>

      <h2>Personal SWOT analysis</h2>
  
      <div>Strength: Researching the internet has always been a strong point for me as I like to get a broader perspective on different views.
        Through this attribute I am able to collectively gain greater information and pick out what to use and interpret for myself.</div>
     <div>Weakness:Asking for extra support is something I should be doing more often, as I can be too focused on trying to finish a task by myself.
       I believe that working more in teams will help me ask sooner for the experience and expertises others may have. </div>
    </div>
    <div>Opportunities: If I adopt a more open style to my work â€“ for example discussing with my colleagues, professor or tutor, early on what I am aiming to do, and discuss with them ideas for tackling the most challenging aspects of a piece of work, 
      I will become better at both anticipating issues and using the skills and knowledge of people around me more effectively.</div>
  </div>
  <div>Threats: Time management was in the past an area of improvement for me. However, since I started military service in Switzerland this has vastly improved.</div>

      <h2>Feedback</h2>
      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:100px;">Hi Maurice,
        
        Thank you for filling in the who am I form! By reading through your motivation and the future job description, I can tell you really put a great effort into the details and inform yourself of what it is you would like to achieve. I do believe our program will be a good fit for you.
        
        You are definitely not alone in needing to learn to ask for help. It is very much a developer's trade to not do so, however within a project and a deadline to achieve you cannot afford not to. You will get a chance within the program to start developing these skills.
        
        In regards to your question, you will have a study career coach appointed to you who will be having a quarterly conversation with and based on your personal situation can refer you to other support (Dean, Psychologist etc) We also offer a Buddy program, a fellow second years student who will show you how everything works and where to find information or ask for help. We make use of class assistants who will help too and because of the open culture, the door of the teacher's rooms is always open to getting help and guidance. We also have an international office that will help you with Dutch culture specifics.
        
        Looking forward to seeing you soon
        
        Kind regards,
        
        Daphne Heertjes</div>

      <h3>ICT field of study</h3>
      <p>Information and communication technology (ICT) is a term enclosing all the technologies and services included in computing, information management, telecommunications provision, and the internet. Those technologies all deal with the transmission and reception of facts of some kind. ICT permeates all components of life, providing newer, better, and faster ways for human beings to interact, network, seek help, gain access to records and learn. The information and communications technology (ICT) sector is one of the most exciting and thrilling areas to work and not only is the pay structure good but the sector involves an extensive number of areas like programming, business consulting, and development, and sales and marketing roles. Initially, graduates can only find jobs in the core domains like IT & Telecom.
         But now they are also making their career in the Financial Services, Real Estate, Manufacturing and other industries.</p>
