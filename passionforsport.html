    <h1>All achievements in life necessitate motivation. For instance, the willingness to execute a task requires motivation to ignite initiative.
      And, in sports, maintaining balanced motivation is key to completing tasks to create a successful result. The operative word, here, is ‘balanced’ motivation.
      High levels of motivation may become the reason for anxiety and stress, while low motivation levels may render a person completely hopeless and inactive.
      Athletes are nurtured by clear goal setting. A façade is usually created by social media that only shows athletes’ winning moments that are full of motivation and excitement. 
      It fails to throw light on their concerted efforts and struggle to surpass training to get to where they are.
      It also fails to show the low moments, with lack of motivation, withering confidence, and the insane amount of pressure. As in a recent interview with Forbes India, Virat Kohli, 
      mentioned, “Everyone feels pressure and feels nervous, because your mind is playing tricks on you. If anyone can claim that he or she has never been under pressure then it would be a lie.”
  Although, most athletes possess natural talents, certain motivating factors drive them to success. From a psychological perspective, humans possess the need for competence, autonomy, and connection. 
      This grows from positive substantiation. To satisfy these needs, athletes diligently work hard and succeed. Moreover, other motivating factors that may drive athletic action are intrinsic and extrinsic in nature. 
      That means, motivation comes from inside a person or from outside—the environment. Intrinsic factors include sense of achievement and success, pleasure or joy; 
      while extrinsic factors include ego-satisfaction, winning a reward, or forcefully completing a target.</h1>
